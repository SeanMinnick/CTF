	Now presenting [cowsay as a service](https://caas.mars.picoctf.net)

this challenge is mostly meant to be fun, it takes you to basic page telling you to add /cowsay/{message} to the url and it will print out that message in cowsay. Admittedly didn't know where to go for a second, as I was trying to get some information on where the message was going through the js file they give you as the source code. I tried adding ;pwd to the end of the url and it printed out /app letting me know linux commands would work

After that I did ls to find "falg.txt" which i printed to get the flag comically set as mooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo0o
